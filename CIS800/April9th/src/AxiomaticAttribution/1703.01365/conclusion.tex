\section{Conclusion}

The primary contribution of this paper is a method called integrated
gradients that attributes the prediction of a deep network to its
inputs. It can be implemented using a few calls to the gradients
operator, can be applied to a variety of deep networks, and has a
strong theoretical justification.

A secondary contribution of this paper is to clarify desirable
features of an attribution method using an axiomatic framework
inspired by cost-sharing literature from economics. Without the
axiomatic approach it is hard to tell whether the 
attribution method is affected by data artifacts, network's artifacts or
artifacts of the method. The axiomatic approach rules out
artifacts of the last type.

While our and other works have made some progress on understanding
the relative importance of input features in a deep network,
we have not addressed the interactions between the input features or
the logic employed by the network. So there remain many unanswered
questions in terms of debugging the I/O behavior of a deep
network.
